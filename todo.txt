Qi4CS:
 - Refactor Model/Validation: make ValidationResultType the same way as CompositeModelType, and store all errors in a single list.
 - Fragment order specification at bootstrap level.
 - More than one class per assembly per composite
 - Architecture-global concerns, side-effects (no mixins nor constraints(?))
  - Fragment search order: composite declaration -> architecture-global -> the ones via DefaultXXX attributes
 - CompositeEvent: Add 'Boolean oneTime = false' to addition/removal methods. Modify code generation as needed.
 
IDE plugin / MSBuild:
 - Manage code-generation and strong names via UI
 - Manage bootstrapper object
 - MSBuild task to support private bin paths specified in .csproj file
